                China.</p>
              <p class="mt-4 fs-5">Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever,
                cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe
                cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory
                syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>
              <p class="mt-4 fs-5">Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include
                regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and
                sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact

                          Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and 
                          feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged 
                          to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                          COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) an Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other
                          examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information 
                          about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus

                          This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to
                          a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It's important to note 
                          that person-to-person spread can happen 
                          on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                          The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community ("community spread") in some affected geographic areas.
                          Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area. D including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

                          The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 
                          can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital
                          or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

                        <p>
                          How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on 
                          a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health
                          officials and involves considering specifics of each situation 
                          including disease severity, iliness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.

                          Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and 
                          includes meeting all of the following requirements:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.

                        <p>
                          The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough

                        <p>
                          The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.

                          Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person througl respiratory droplets. 
                          Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing
                          or eating food it is important te always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general
                          food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                          It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or obj that has the virus on it and then 
                          touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly thei eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                          In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces. the is likely very low risk of

                        <p><strong>Protection measures for everyone</strong></p>
                        <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

                        You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<strong>
                            Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
                            <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                              <strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</li>
                            <li><p>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
                            <p><strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</p></li>
                            <li><p>
                              Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Why?</strong>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                              Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.
                              This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
                            </li>
                            <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
                            <strong> Why? </strong> You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.</li>

                        Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

                        WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks).

                        The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.

                        The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more 
                        likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                        No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

                        The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.

                        Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
